# Paint Forge - Corrected Files for GitHub Upload

These are the corrected files with all @ alias imports converted to relative paths for successful Render deployment.

## Files to Replace on GitHub:

1. `client/src/pages/login.tsx` - Fixed all @ alias imports
2. `client/src/pages/landing.tsx` - Fixed all @ alias imports  
3. `client/src/components/layout/header.tsx` - Fixed all @ alias imports
4. `client/vite.config.js` - Simplified for production builds
5. `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` - Fixed circular dependencies
6. `client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Fixed circular dependencies
7. `client/public/logo.png` - Logo asset file

## Instructions:

1. Download all files from the corrected-files directory
2. Upload them to your GitHub repository, replacing the existing files
3. Render deployment will automatically trigger and succeed

All @ alias imports have been systematically converted to relative paths for successful deployment.
